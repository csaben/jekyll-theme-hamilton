## Outline for Spring Break Progress

- sine function computational graph
- developing sine function nn from scratch (numpy, python, no torch, etc.)
- 2d weight analysis tool (neural circuit research add-on)
- plain research: loss functions fs and wind farm data collection+comprehrension
- [will update as needed]

(I will make another post for discussing the morale for putting this site together in a future post)

## Formatting

My aim is to aggregate my sub-projects as I put together my URES research into individual posts that will be linked to an open colab notebook for viewing.

After I complete my research for this semester I plan to convert this project into a course with the mini-projects I make for myself as the material and the notes+resources I have accumulated as references to learn by doing.

# Building a Sequencer to speed up my workflow

I often find myself recreating and reordering my schedule at the end of every
day to align with my long term goals and the minutiae of everyday task such as
homework.

My intent with this project is to build a framework that allows me to still
add new minigoals and projects while not having to worry about how to fit them
into the larger puzzle of my life.

Dross is a mind spirit in a favorite book of mine, Cradle. And it feels appropriate
to name this personal scheduler after him akin to how he generates battle plans
in the book.

It will become clear if I am able to replicate his reliability to any fidelity 
over the course of this semester as I work on the ETL and Training Pipeline.

## Outline ##

Dross is gonna need some food and I will endeavor to format it all well enough
that when it comes to building a state machine for me to label a set of todos
into a sequence I would ordinarily comply to that a bunch of unnecessary changes
don't become necessary

I'll be organizing the food based on the following information;

(one day I will have to cover things in this list with some depth to give context)

___

### Courses List ###
<ul>
<li>Astrophysics</li>
<li>Differential Geometry</li>
<li>Java 220</li>
<li>Java 240</li>
<li>Multivariable Calculus</li>
<li>Linear Algebra</li>
<li>Deep Learning w/ Python</li>
</ul>

___

### Goal Associated with List ###
<ul>
<li>Dross Chatbot</li>
<li>Dross Sequencer</li>
<li>Edge ai device</li>
<li>Simulacra Project</li>
<li>Radapp Project</li>
<li>Neuro Research</li>
<li>Climbing</li>
<li>Helium</li>
<li>Vim</li>
<li>Kaggle</li>
*can and will be added to (NDE kidger paper, structure function specifics go with tasking)* 
</ul>

___

### Tasks ###
<ul>
<li>Lab assignment</li>
<li>Structure function readings</li>
<li>Multivariable calculus homework</li>
<li>Linear algebra homework</li>
<li>To Be Continued</li> 

*current idea is to simply append tasking with the goal / class token associated with each at the front or end of the embedding (bake the correlating of task to goal/class from the outset)* 
</ul>

  <li>Research impostor syndrome. You should describe what it is, what its effects are, and how many people are affected by it. You will need to find at least one source on this. (To cite it, just provide a link and say what the source is)</li>
  <li>Next write about whether you have experienced this as a computer science major. If so, describe when, and how it has affected you. If you have not experienced impostor syndrome as computer scientist, but have in other areas of your life, you can write about that instead.</li>
  <li>Read the article Programmer Imposter Syndrome: 6 Ways to Get Over Yours by Ethan Urie. Summarize this article, and discuss his tips for dealing with this issue. Talk about his tips and whether or not you think they would be effective.</li>
  <li>Lastly, describe another way that you think one could combat impostor syndrome.</li>
</ol>

I would describe impostor syndrome as feeling like you are not qualified to be in
the position you may currently be in or are currently working towards.<br>

Some effects might include self-doubt and fear of being ousted once people come
to understand you don't know what you are doing.<br>

According to nbcphiladalphia approximately 33% of Americans experience impostor syndrome.<br>

I have experienced impostor syndrome all throughout my formal education and as 
well as initially during my first internship.<br>

I find that it can harm my ability to do research earnestly.<br>

By this I mean that in school I might not ask a question in a high level course
as I assume it must have been covered already and I might sound silly for bringing it up.<br>

In the first week of my internship I would spin my wheels on an implementation for
an hour or two and feel like I was taking too long and force a less rounded out solution
that I later found myself re-implementing. 

The solution in the first case is to toss aside any fledgingling pride and just ask. 
The whole point of education is to be less wrong so if you don't know or can't wait
until after lecture, ask.

The solution in the second case came in the form of advice from my peer mentor,
"Assume your code breaking hurts someone. Take the time it takes to get it right, in
the future implementing something similar will become more familiar and take less time
anyways" ~paraphrasing

Summary;<br>
1) it doesn't go away so get used to it<br>
learning is akin to lighting a fire, not filling a finite bucket. There is always more wood to add.<br><br>
2) choose to have a growth mindset<br>
most people have affinities due to the random initialization of their neurons and plasticity
they have developed so far. If that is to be true, anyone can learn anything if they break
out of their local minima in a given topic<br><br>
3) log your accomplishments<br>
100% agree. if not for others, atleast for yourself as a way to look back in the past.<br><br>
5) find how you learn the best<br>
100% agree.<br><br>
6) plan your career goals to reduce doubt<br>
yes, but see add-on.

<strong>TL;DR</strong> I think all of his points are valid.<br>

I would say that career goal planning should be extended to future-self planning, however.<br>

Outside of simply career goals, who do you <i>see</i> yourself as?<br>

What capabilities and skills related or not to your career do you have? If you are working
towards being a better version of yourself in many ways, you should also document that. It's
possible 6 months from now you are only a little better at programming than before and that feels like not enough, but
are you accounting for a different life skill you acquired in the meantime? Every progression
should be tracked so as to accurately reflect how you spend your time: time spent dictates
skills gained (solid counter examples exist, but by and large this is the way it seems to work).

The way I find impostor syndrome dies best is to push forward. Go learn and build more.<br>

If you spend enough time diligently practicing you will be better. The next step of that,
of course, is choosing to respect what you have accomplished.<br>
